## 🔐 What is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to:

> **Bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.**

---

## 🧠 Why Encapsulation?

Encapsulation helps:

* **Protect internal object state**
* **Prevent unintended interference or misuse**
* **Promote modularity and maintainability**
* **Control how data is accessed or modified**

In short, it helps **hide the internal implementation details** from the outside world and **expose only what's necessary**.

## 🔧 How Encapsulation is Implemented in C++

### ✅ Using **Access Specifiers**:

C++ uses **three access specifiers** to control access to class members:

| Access Specifier | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `private`        | Members are accessible only within the same class |
| `protected`      | Accessible in the class and derived classes       |
| `public`         | Members are accessible from outside the class     |

---

### 📌 Example: Basic Encapsulation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
private:
    string name;
    int age;

public:
    // Setter function
    void setName(string empName) {
        name = empName;
    }

    void setAge(int empAge) {
        if (empAge > 18)
            age = empAge;
    }

    // Getter function
    string getName() {
        return name;
    }

    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
};

int main() {
    Employee emp;
    emp.setName("Alice");
    emp.setAge(25);

    cout << "Employee Name: " << emp.getName() << endl;
    cout << "Employee Age: " << emp.getAge() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### 🔍 Key Points:

* `name` and `age` are **private**: they cannot be accessed directly.
* Access is given through **public setter and getter** methods.
* You can **validate** data inside setters (like age > 18), which adds control and protection.

## 🧱 Benefits of Encapsulation

### 1. ✅ **Data Hiding**

Internal details are hidden from the outside world, reducing complexity and potential misuse.

### 2. 🛡️ **Improved Security**

You can restrict access and allow only safe interaction with your data (e.g., prevent negative salary).

### 3. 🧩 **Modularity**

Each object/component can be treated as a "black box", which improves modularity and testability.

### 4. 🔄 **Flexibility & Maintainability**

Implementation can change without affecting external code. You can refactor internal logic without breaking public interfaces.

## 🔄 Without Encapsulation (Bad Practice)

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    string name;
    int age;
};

int main() {
    Employee e;
    e.age = -10;  // Invalid, no validation
}
```

🚫 This breaks the idea of controlling the internal state. Anyone can assign invalid values.

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Think of a **vending machine**:

* You press buttons to choose drinks (public interface).
* You can’t see or touch internal wiring or mechanisms (private logic).
* You don’t care *how* it works internally, just that it works and gives you the drink.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation     | Wrapping data and methods together into one unit (class) and restricting access |
